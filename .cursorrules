## Core Directives

- Read `AGENTS.md` in the project root for universal agent instructions.
- Read `.agent/STATE.md` before doing anything — it has current task context.
- Follow the GSD Protocol: Discuss → Plan → Execute → Verify.
- Check `.agent/skills/` for specialized guides before starting any task.

## Project Context

- `AGENTS.md` — Universal agent instructions.
- `.agent/PROJECT.md` — Tech stack and vision.
- `.agent/STATE.md` — Current task and next steps.
- `.agent/ROADMAP.md` — Strategic milestones.

## Skills

All agentic skills live in `.agent/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with instructions.
