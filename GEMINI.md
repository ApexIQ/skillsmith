## Prime Directives

1. **Read `AGENTS.md`** for universal agent instructions.
2. **Read `.agent/STATE.md`** before doing anything — it has current task context.
3. **Follow GSD Protocol**: Discuss → Plan → Execute → Verify.
4. **Use Skills**: Check `.agent/skills/` for specialized guides before starting any task.

## Context Files

@AGENTS.md
@.agent/PROJECT.md
@.agent/STATE.md
@.agent/ROADMAP.md

## Skills

All agentic skills live in `.agent/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter.
Run `skillsmith list` to see available skills.
