## Workflow Protocol

Follow the GSD (Get Shit Done) protocol:
1. **Discuss** — Understand the task fully before acting.

3. **Execute** — Implement in atomic, verifiable steps.
4. **Verify** — Test and confirm each step works.

When starting a task, check if a relevant skill exists first.
Run `skillsmith list` to see available skills.
